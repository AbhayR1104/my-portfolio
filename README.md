## Description

This portfolio is a modern, responsive single-page application built with React and Vite. It serves as a central hub to introduce myself, highlight my professional experience at companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tata Elxsi, and display my technical skills across various domains.

The design is implemented with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI for a clean, professional aesthetic.
